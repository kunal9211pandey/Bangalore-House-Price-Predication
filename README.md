# Bangalore House Price Prediction

This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices in Bangalore, India. It aims to provide a valuable tool for homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals to estimate property values accurately.

## Overview

The Bangalore House Price Prediction project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle to train a machine learning model that can estimate house prices based on various features. The project emphasizes data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection to achieve reliable predictions.

## Core Features

* **House Price Prediction:** Predicts the price of a house based on its features.
* **Data-Driven Insights:** Provides insights into the factors that influence house prices in Bangalore.
* **Open Source:** The code is open source and can be used as a starting point for further research and development.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language used for data analysis and model building.
* **Pandas:** A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. 
* **NumPy:** A fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. 
* **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Libraries for creating informative and visually appealing data visualizations. 
* **Scikit-learn:** A comprehensive machine learning library for tasks like model training, evaluation, and selection. 

## Approach

The project follows a structured methodology:

1.  **Data Collection:**
   
    * The dataset used is the "Bangalore House Price Prediction" dataset from Kaggle. 
    * It contains information on various properties in Bangalore.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:**
   
    * Handling Missing Values: Strategies are employed to deal with missing data in different features.  
    * Feature Selection: Irrelevant or redundant features are removed to simplify the model and improve performance.  
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   
    * Visualizing data distributions and relationships to gain insights.
    * Examples include plotting price vs. square footage and analyzing the frequency of different house sizes.  
4.  **Feature Engineering:**
   
    * Creating new features, such as "price per square foot," to provide additional information to the model.  
5.  **Outlier Detection and Removal:**
   
    * Identifying and removing data points that deviate significantly from the general trend.  
6.  **Model Selection and Training:**
   
    * Training several machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression) and comparing their performance using techniques like GridSearchCV and cross-validation. [179]
7.  **Model Evaluation:**
   
    * Assessing the accuracy and reliability of the chosen model using metrics like R-squared score. [176]
8.  **Prediction:**
   
    * Using the trained model to predict house prices for new input data. [181]
